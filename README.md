This is an unfinished game I began writing during my first semester of college. It is essentially a "reverse" tower defense game.
I put a lot of work into it, but never finished it for a few reasons:

1. It wasn't quite as fun to play as I imagined it would be
2. There were more interesting projects I wanted to work on
3. Flash was clearly on the decline
 
This was by far my most ambitious programming project at the time
